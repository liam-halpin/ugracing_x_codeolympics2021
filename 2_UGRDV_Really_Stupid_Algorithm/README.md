# Challenge 2: UGRDV Really-Stupid-Algorithm (medium)

Thanks to you, our team head saw the error in his ways, so he got the IT team to help him with his password security. They told him to use an *actual* encryption algorithm, so he opted for RSA.  However, IT seem to think that because his password is encrypted, and without access to the decryption key, his password is safe.

Write a program to decrypt the encrypted password (`c`) using the prime numbers specified in the file (`p`, `q`, and `e`). Your program should return the password in cleartext

**HINT**: Do you understand RSA? Here's a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) that might help...
